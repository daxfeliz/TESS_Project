I am trying to find some good TESS light curve examples of different star types to help with our classification efforts as we look for transit events. 
As I find some, I'll make sure to upload them to the TESS_Project website. For now, here is a pretty good compilation of light curve classifications 
from AAVSO (American Association of Variable Star Observers):
